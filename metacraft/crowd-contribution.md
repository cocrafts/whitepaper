### Crowd Contribution

Metacraft Framework is open-source and built by the crowd community.

We need it transparent, clear, and valuable for everyone in the community - this is the reason we have developed Collaboration Platform for Builder and Player with the plan that is opened step by step:

1. **Foundation world:**
Crowd Contribution mainly focuses on building `ATEM`  by `Metacraft Studio` leading from the lore to direction of the game.

2. **Extended world:**
Collaboration Platform will be opened for everyone who cares `ATEM` world and want to build new games on it.

3. **Open world:**
Outside of `ATEM` series, Metacraft at this stage is ready for unlimited possibility — any project/lore/series could be submitted and funded (or self-fun on top of Metacraft). We welcome Builder and Player to join and do whatever they want to make strong and stable for Metacraft framework.

#### Collaboration Platform

Collaboration platform gathers Artist, Engineer, Writer… who have experience in the newly created GameFi industry, with many levels from fresher to senior. Creator, who want to build their game come to Metacraft to connect with others, co-found their team or hire existing Builders from the collaboration network, reward them with `MEMI` — great game could be very simple and lean on Builder’s expertise.

Imagine one place where anyone could make something fun, interesting, enjoyable, and no work-mode:

- Forum-like model, where Builders and Players can create new threads easily
- Free to discuss, reply and react
- Follow interesting people or topic

We experiment with collaboration activities from Day one using Notion and Discord before the day Collaboration Platform is live on [stormgate.io](http://stormgate.io)

**Reward mechanism**
There will be an open-source code/algorithm to extract/calculate rewards for creator/builder/player based on their contribution activities and interaction with the community on their stuffs (e.g like, up-vote count). This mechanism won’t be perfect, nothing is — however it is transparent and neutral, the community themself contributes to this algorithm and adjust it together.

#### Builder

Builder is the crowd community and is the true maker of all games, novels and beyond which happens at [stormgate.io](http://Stormgate.io). Starting from the idea of “decentralized” Game Studio, it is not only core team employees recruited to work on the game; it’s the crowd who are gamers or enthusiasts who know what the games should be.

Builder could be anyone, from any background, or age. They could be Student at age of 15, a Construction Builder loves computer and coding, a retired Lawyer who still enjoys working, or a Housewives who love drawing and writing, and many more. As long as one has Internet and a mobile device/desktop, everything is possible.

What Builder contribute at Metacraft is no limited. From the idea for the lore, art, game, etc… as can draw small icon, design some buttons on website, find the issues/bugs on games, write chapter of novel, or help anybody in the community to onboard with Metacraft. All together build and play on `Collaboration Platform`.

**Builder path at Metacraft:**
Collaboration Platform is suitable for whoever wants to make game in blockchain technology, or have ideas but lack resource. They don’t need to worry about hiring people, manage lots of resources anymore, just bring their story and people who are convinced by it will support them.

More game coming, more jobs for builder, more `MEMI` they will receive. We believe it will bring more chances and the better life for our contributors, and will become their motivation for long-term relationship with Metacraft framework.

- Start from co-building games in `ATEM` with `Metacraft Studio`, e.g. `Under Realm`
- Continue with games based on `ATEM` world lore of any studio/or their own team
- Keep it grow with their own fictional lore /outside the `ATEM` world

#### Player

Players are drawn to a virtual world with exciting strategy-focused, dynamic gameplay, with an interesting lore , and vibrant in-game community. And by spicing up with blockchain/ `NFT` element, players are empowered with true ownership of the in-game digital assets and able to earn meaningful currencies and items just by playing game.

A player does not just simply play our games and have fun. Rather than just a vague statement, by developing and applying the Metacraft Framework, we actually create a platform for our players to be actively involved in the development and improvement of the games as a builder. With Metacraft Framework, players will be able to make any change, adding new features, game mode, etc… with ease and get reward for these contributions. It could be as simple as adding a new soundtrack, a witty script, or even creating a whole new game. This mechanism is not only exciting for the players as we proved our players' ideas matter, it also lets our players decide the game they want to play as gradually, dedicated players can become decision-makers and shape the future of `ATEM` as a core team member.

**Player path at Metacraft:**

- Enjoy the game to the fullest and variety of game genres from `ATEM` world to outside `ATEM` world in the long term
- One place to share emotions with game mates
- Earn rewards, in-game tokens, `MEMI` from events, championship tournaments, top player
- `ATEM Hero`: A single player/ Group of players who conquer the `ATEM` world by winning the Main game

We firmly believe our players and community are the key for us to break through and we aim to have our games truly owned, designed, built by the players, for the players.

With the release of Under Realm: Rise of Magic Alpha version in Q4, 2022, lots more fun is coming and everyone can sign-up for the [waiting list](https://stormgate.io/alpha-sign-up).
