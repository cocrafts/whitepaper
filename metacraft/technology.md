### Technology

Metacraft loves open source and has it in our heart, most of our project is currently public in [Official Github organization](https://github.com/cocrafts). Allow “anyone can join, and build together” always number one priority since day one.

#### Transparent and open
Metacraft wants to be a part of the opensource community, along the way building Metacraft product — tool/library like [metacraft-cli](https://github.com/cocrafts/metacraft-cli), [metacraft-ui](https://github.com/cocrafts/metacraft-ui) are designed to work with generic type of project for anyone else. It’s important to keep the fire and have fun together, not just inside Metacraft ecosystem.

Except for security purposes, we made a promise to publish almost everything we do — source code of Games, Smart Contracts, Websites, Mobile Applications.. will be there on [Github](https://github.com/cocrafts), open and [MIT licensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
There are already projects we public already, but important projects still under security audit before we could open them to the public.

#### Dual wield
Even the entire technology stack is quite complicated and requires different kinds of technologies to get thing done in the right way. Metacraft will stay focus on 2 main programming language [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)) and  [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

**TypeScript** will be used almost everywhere for rapid prototyping product, it’s an easy and efficient language for anyone from various different backgrounds.
**Rust**, on another hand will be used for critical-mission stuffs that require performance (we compile Rust to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) and use it together with **TypeScript** on Browser or Mobile **React Native** Apps) — Rust also the main language for our Smart Contracts.

#### Decentralize on Blockchain

Blockchain is an important aspect of Metacraft — to keep it decentralized and transparent from the ground up. Metacraft operates on top of [SOLANA](https://solana.com/) network, we strongly believe in the vision of [SOLANA](https://solana.com/) founding team, keep the network fast and cost-efficient for massive micro-transactions is critical to keep Metacraft community open and crowd with a lot of activities, not just including Games.

Further than the technology, Metacraft wants to contribute part of our small effort to help Blockchain space progress in positive direction. We introduced [Metacraft Framework](https://github.com/cocrafts/whitepaper/blob/master/metacraft/framework.md), our experiment to use Blockchain in another way, that we thought useful and trustful for the crowd.

Metacraft is also seeking interesting team/ideas out there to interact with, we’re eager to collaborate/contribute to the development of Blockchain space in general.
