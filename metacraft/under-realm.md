### Under Realm
![alt text](https://github.com/cocrafts/whitepaper/blob/master/assets/img/under-realm.png?raw=true)

**Under Realm: Rise of Magic** - the first game in ATEM world produced mainly by Metacraft Studio. We chose a *“not much challenging*” 2D type which is a turn-based Trading card game, and there are 4 reason behind this decision:

1. **Board game lover:** We, the core developer member, love Board games like Uno, Exploding Kittens, Monopoly and the legendary childhood Yugioh! - from a collect very cheap fake paper card to a Computer version; Hearthstone. Easy to onboard but hard to be a good player, friends time together, card collection, etc. are all we can recall those happy moment. We even normally create new rules when playing these board games, so we do the same to Under Realm.
2. **‘Comfortable’ entry for 1st-time game developers:** Speaking of engineering part, our core developers have never ever built a serious commercial game and this is our first time officially. Understanding game industry is not a joke, 2D seems to be a good entry point for such 1st-time and amateur game developers to this industry. However, with the base of a pretty good engineer background of 10+ years of experience, we hope that struggles and challenges are a bit let. For this reason, we’re developing Under Realm with [Cocos Creater](https://www.cocos.com/) - “A mature open source cross-platform game development framework” and free, so anyone can easily join Under Realm development journey with us.
3. **Trading card game has its own community already**: The collectible card game, also called a trading card game was first known in 1993 by *Magic: The Gathering.* Since then, with the appearance of Yugi Oh!, Hearth stone, the position of the trading card game becomes even more solid in the game world. It has its own community already, and we don’t need to educate players. It helps us - a game start-up starts with some advantages.
4. **Huge and long live market:** Card game, to us, is legendary and a lot of people love card games (at least to us). Card game existed since woodblock printing technology, and it still exist today in many ways and the market size is massive. Global board games market (including card game) was valued at USD 13.75 billion in 2021, and it is expected to reach a value of USD 30.93 billion by 2028. So, all we hope is to be simply one of small guy in this big market, creating another interesting gameplay that we love to play by ourselves first, and we hope existing card game lovers and others love it too.

**About Under Realm**

Under Realm takes place in a chaotic, fragmented world of ATEM where human and other races are constantly fighting each other, to wrench the endless thirst for power, wealth, and gradually take control over ATEM.

Steel, blood and brute force were the main material of the savage battles until mysteriously, mankind discovered the long-lost magical scripts that allow them to summon mighty, ancient creatures/ entities that can turn the tide in no time. And no one wants to be left behind in this race. Adventurers across ATEM are desired by factions to discover the forgotten dungeons across this continent. Players join the Under Realm as Adventurers who will confront each other in the search for the long-lost scripts in hidden dungeon across ATEM.

Metacraft Mineral will be used to fuel and allow mankind to use magic, including and not limited to summoning ancient creatures from the sealed scripts and creating new scripts.

Under Realm has 2 modes: Free to play and NFT.

- **Free-to-play:** The main game mode where all players are able to purely enjoy the game with the original decks.
- **NFT:** Experimental mode where players can build, truly own and trade their decks while still keeping the game balance in its own way.

Note: These two modes are totally separated from each other and players cannot cross-play.
